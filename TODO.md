Right now, not every response from an agent in the crew is being output to the chainlit UI. We need to figure out how to get each output from every task and agent printed in chainlit. We need to display the planning steps, self-checks and final result. this is probably because of unique events emitted by crewai, I'll need to capture them and emit them as chainlit messages. Ok, we added the listener, but its not working, we'll need to debug.
